"Medisync is a hospital-based solution I developed to streamline patient flow in OPDs, manage bed availability, and handle patient admissions efficiently.
I used React.js for the frontend, PHP and Express.js for backend logic, and MySQL for the database.
One interesting part was integrating the Overpass API to fetch location-based hospital data.
The system was built to be scalable, with a vision to integrate city-wide hospital networks.
It taught me a lot about multi-role user management and how to handle real-time hospital data."
